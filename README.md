# Lab 2 - Data Classification & Chatbots

Both scripts were completed as Lab 2 Data Classification and Chatbots for the Clark University course IDCE 302 Python Programming taught by Professor Shadrock Roberts. 

### Problems Encountered
Script 2 requires input from the user. In order to write my if, elif, else statement, which uses a calculation of the current year entered minus the age of the user, I had to convert the inputted value to an integer using the int function. I forgot this on my first try and the the script was not working, but I was able to debug it fairly quick. 

## Script 1 - Classifying Data

The first script provided, called Jess_Strzempko_Data-Classification_Lab2a, creates a function called feelTemp that sorts a given temperature (in Fahrenheit) into four categorical levels, hot, warm, cool, and cold using the following criteria:

- If the temperature is greater than or equal to 100, the functions returns “It is hot.”;
- If the temperature is less than 100 but greater than or equal to 70, the function returns “It is warm.”;
- If the temperature is less than 70 but greater than or equal to 32, the functions return “It is cool.”;
- If the temperature is less than 32, it returns “It is cold.”

When running the program, the user is prompted to input a temperature in Fahrenheit. The program then prints one of the four categorical levels (hot, warm, cool, and cold) that the given temperature falls into.

## Script 2 - Create your first chatbot!

The second script provided, called Jess_Strzempko_Chatbots_Lab2b, is a simple chatbot that has a conversation with the user based on user-inputted values. If, else, and elif statements as well as print statements and type conversions are used to decide on which output is given. In this program, the chat bot is disguised as a time traveler asking questions about the user. The only way to keep the conversation going is to answer the time traveler's questions. 

# Code

Users can download and run the 2 python scripts in Colab notebooks. Both script require user answers as inputs and will give outputs according to the decisions the user makes. If problems are encountered, users can contact Jess Strzempko at JeStrzempko@clarku.edu for more help and further information.
